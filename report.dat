#0 Notice that line number may not be accurate due to the change of code, just an approximate indication of the location where the bugs happened. 


#1 the typo when including headers. Should be #include but not #inlucde. 
#2 line 56, should be scanf, since now we want to know the name of the file we want to open. 
#3 line 64, fscanf should just be scanf, since now we just want to read command from console. 
#4 line 66, using strcmp without including the string library. 
#5 line 67, 72, using fork and sleep without including the unistd library. 
#6 line 69, passing a null argument to execvp when you cannot do it. 
#7 in print_help.o, in 2c: b8 doesn't match with the given assembly code.
#8 line 29, num_wallets should not be 5000000, it should take in the parameter read from input file. Also fixed in main funtion. 
#9 line 41, passed in wallet[i].key twice. 
#10 I am not sure if this is a bug, the program is not able to handle the case where user prints without generating wallets first. I added this error handling section. 
#11 line 58, if the input filename is not a valid file, the program cannot handle it. Fixed this problem. 
#12 line 64, if the input file does not contain a valid integer, the program still runs, which should not happen. Fixed this part.
