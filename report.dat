#1 the typo when including headers. Should be #include but not #inlucde. 
#2 line 56, should be scanf, since now we want to know the name of the file we want to open. 
#3 line 64, fscanf should just be scanf, since now we just want to read command from console. 
#4 line 66, using strcmp without including the string library. 
#5 line 67, 72, using fork and sleep without including the unistd library. 
#6 line 69, passing a null argument to execvp when you cannot do it.
